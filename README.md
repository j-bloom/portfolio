# J-bloom portfolio
Hello and Welcome!  
This repo contains my portfolio, which is currently written in HTML. 
This portfolio is currently built with HTML, CSS and some Javascript.  
The reason for this decision rather than focusing on React, flask or other web frameworks, is I wanted to build something different.  
I am also currently focusing on improving my php, which also contributed to this decision. The goal is to build this as an SPA, and then eventually convert 
this using php into a wordpress theme that will allow others to build a portfolio and provide another layout option.  
<br>
To give credit where credit is due, a lot of this layout is inspired from a [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) design with some tweaks added to it.
